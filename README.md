# Slim 3 web Service with Sample TypeScript client side code
A web service built using slim 3that also uses the "mnapoli/front-yaml" composer library to search in Yaml tags in a folder _post.

This was an example built to see if it can be used as either a quick way to replace my Jekyll site serach engine, or create a new site in php, using the existing posts folder from the old site.

Decided not to go that route, but thought would upload here if someone else can have an idea for it.
